1. Eye-Aspect Ratio-Based Drowsiness Detection
Author: Soukupová, T. & Čech, J. (2016)
Title: "Real-Time Eye Blink Detection using Facial Landmarks"
Summary:
This work introduced the concept of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), a reliable metric for detecting eye closure by analyzing the ratio of distances between vertical and horizontal eye landmarks. The research demonstrated the robustness of EAR in real-time applications, particularly for detecting blinks and prolonged eye closure. The method's low computational overhead makes it suitable for real-time fatigue detection, serving as a foundational algorithm for this project.
Relevance to Project:
The EAR metric forms a critical component of the facial analysis in the proposed system, providing reliable indications of drowsiness through prolonged eye closures.
